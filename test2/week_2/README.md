###### OS is manager of the computer's resources, so it adds overhead to the actual user code 
###### effective length of the code = raw user code + overhead added by OS
###### CPU performance is measure by benchmarks by measuring the the time teaken by the CPU to execute the raw user code. This time is called the execution time of the CPU.
