## RISCV-HDP Training week2 
#### This week's training has two sessions , in the following sections I describe my learnings during these sessions and paths to the related assignments.

### What did I learn in Week2_Session1

#### Topics

#### How fast is your processor? How is CPU performance measured?

##### CPU exexcution time  Vs CPU  response time

###### OS is manager of the computer's resources, so it adds overhead to the actual user code 
###### effective length of the code = raw user code + overhead added by OS
###### CPU performance is measure by benchmarks by measuring the the time teaken by the CPU to execute the raw user code. This time is called the execution time of the CPU.

#### In real world to measure speed of anything a clock is used , Computers are no exception .
##### Clock is given to the computer , which feed the sequential logic of the cpu. Ultimate aim of the CPU designers is to increase the clock speed , that is to reduce clock period by scaling transistors , improving the microarchitecture etc.

#### So how do we really measure the CPU performance. Formulas to measure CPU performance 
<img width="620" alt="clock_speed1" src="https://github.com/jaya117/gitlearn_new/assets/139655462/82e553a0-2ef0-4c6d-8ad2-f6e1632111ea">

#### Example of CPU time calculation
<img width="636" alt="cpu_time_calculation" src="https://github.com/jaya117/gitlearn_new/assets/139655462/b9a4b287-4c42-459f-a98b-f368fce3fba6">

#### If in above example each instruction on an average takes 5 cycles to exceute then this system is exceuting 4 billion instructions in 20 second which is a HUGE number

#### While measuring and comparing the CPU performance the only bottom line is CPU time taken by various CPUs for performing the same task. The CPU clock rate or the number of clock cycle that a cpu takes to execute an instruction do not provide any information about it's relative performance with respect to other CPUs. As shown in example below that compares performance of two CPUs 

#### Problem:
<img width="615" alt="perf_comparison1" src="https://github.com/jaya117/gitlearn_new/assets/139655462/e0615fab-cf21-4f8a-904e-075ff4a65cb4">

#### Solution:
<img width="629" alt="perf_comparison2" src="https://github.com/jaya117/gitlearn_new/assets/139655462/44330dcb-d289-4134-a514-104d8ed1cc42">

#### In example above CPU2 may be taking many more cycles to execute the same instruction than CPU1, yet it's performance is better than CPU1 as its CPU time is less than that of CPU1

### Another way of respresnting CPU performance is CPI (Clocks per instruction)
#### In example below the numbers in () in front of each instruction is the clock cycles taken to execute the instruction.
#### Total clock cycles taken to execute all instructions = 3+2+3+3+4+4+4+4+4+2=29
#### Total nuber of instructions = 9
#### Average time to execute one instruction = 29/9= 3.22

#### New formula for CPU performance . 
#### Conclusion  .... Lower CPI = > Higher CPU performance 

<img width="613" alt="CPU_performance_new_formula" src="https://github.com/jaya117/gitlearn_new/assets/139655462/3354efa1-9f6b-4fc7-be86-04988bea6728">

#### However above conclusion is little tricky as it's true only when the clock period is not taken into account

<img width="644" alt="image" src="https://github.com/jaya117/gitlearn_new/assets/139655462/a42c3f3d-0978-40bc-b234-d43f566ce1a4">

### How does the Software code itself impact the performance of the CPU ?

#### Which code sequence is faster in the scenario given below ?
<img width="632" alt="image" src="https://github.com/jaya117/gitlearn_new/assets/139655462/d6658f4e-5474-4ec1-a314-b62d297b9c11">

#### The more a software uses instructions that have larger CPI the worse it's performance is as compared to a software that uses more instructions with smaller CPI 
#### In example below , even though the red software sequence uses more instruction it's total CPI is less as it uses more instructions with smaller CPI as compared to blue sequence
