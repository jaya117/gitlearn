 In this session we discussed more about the chipcron tool and the basic outline of the RISC-V based IoT project that we are 
 going to implement using RISC-V GNU tool chain and chipcrone tool generated hardware. Various steps of the project are as 
 follows - 
 
 1. Choose the IoT project you want to implement, it should be an embedded application one limitation is that the project can 
    not have a wireless interface, as the chipcron tool doesn't support it yet.
 2. Draw a block diagram of the project design
 3.  Create a flowchart for the application
 4. Write  the C program for this application. C program will not use any libarary files , instead we will be writing inline assembly code to access the GPIO regsiter (RISC-V reg X30) . The bits of this register will be connected to GPIO pins of the SOC generated by the chipcrone tool. These GPIO pins will be used by the I/O devices to send input and receive outpiut from the RISC-V core.
